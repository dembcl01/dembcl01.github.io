<h2> What I did this summer </h2>
<p> This summer I was in Decorah doing research with Dr. McNicoll in the Biology department.
I was studying Bumblebees in the tall grass prairie. My main research question is "is there a correlation between the flowers
avaliable to a bee and the abundance and diversity of bees in the community?" My hypothesis is that prairies with more diverse
flowering plant species will have a more diverse community of bees. I am still in the middle of processing my data, so we will see.</p>

<h2> What is my Major? </h2>
<p> <b> Major: </b>Biology </p>
<p> <b> Minor: </b>Secondary Education</p>
<p>I am currently a senior. I will be graduating in Spring of 2015 and I will complete my student teaching after graduation. </p>

<h2> Why am I taking this class? </h2>
<p> I am taking this class for a few reasons.
<ol>
<li> I took Evolutionary Bio last Spring and we did stuff with Python, which was kind of fun. I thought I might see if I liked other programs. </li>
<li> I feel that knowing how to create my own webpage will be a useful skill. As a future teacher, I will probably have a class webpage. The school I am at may use Moodle, or they may not. Regardless, I feel that knowing my way around html, CSS and Javascript will be a useful skill</li>
</ol>
